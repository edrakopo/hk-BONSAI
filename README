==================================
Update : 12th August 2015
Committion to github.

==================================

Usage: 
1. Copy "libWCsimBonsai.so" to WCSim dir. (same directory as libWCsimROOT.so)
2. Copy "fit_param.dat  like.bin sample_bonsai.C" in sample script directory in WCSim dir.

* like.bin should be replaced for each geometry configure.
* Default like.bin is Cyl60.bin (60m cylinder with 20" B&L PMT.)
./sample-root-scripts/likelihood_binary/
Cyl100.bin   : 100m cylinder with 20" B&L PMT
Cyl80.bin    : 80m cylinder with 20" B&L PMT
Cyl60.bin    : 60m cylinder with 20" B&L PMT
HK20PMT.bin  : Egg shape HK with 20" Normal PMT
HK20BL.bin   : Egg shape HK with 20" B&L PMT
SK20BL.bin   : Super-K detector with 20" B&L PMT
SK12BL.bin   : Super-K detector with 12" B&L PMT
SK20PMT.bin  : Super-K detector with 20" Normal PMT (SK-I ~ IV configure.)


==================================
Update : 1st March 2015
Inplement the fuction to read geometry from WCsim root file.

==================================
Current notes and how to build:

This is a first version of bonsai for WCsim.

How to use : 
Just execute "make".
"libWCSimBonsai.so" will be made in a directroy.

How to use :
Copy "libWCSimBonsai.so" to WCsim directory.
Copy "sample-root-scripts/sample_bonsai.C", "sample-root-scripts/like.bin" and "sample-root-scripts/fit_param.dat" to WCsim/sample-root-scripts directory.


** Environment valuable of ROOT (ROOTSYS) should be defined.
